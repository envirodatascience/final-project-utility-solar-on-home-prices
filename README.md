This repository contains a file titled Utility_Solar_and_Home_Prices, which contains code for an analysis exploring the relationship between the proximity of utility scale solar and property values at the neighborhood level. This analysis defines proximity to solar as neighborhoods that fall within within one mile of a solar PV, and those that fall outside the one mile radius as not in proximity. After identifying these neighborhoods, the analysis explores the changes in home price growth (a three-year Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)) by subtracting the growth rate three years prior to solar implementation from the growth rate three years after implementation. Difference-to-Difference plots, which display the annual growth rate in neighborhood prices, and Box and Whisker plots are utilized to display the results of our analysis.
